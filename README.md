# Generalized Golden Spiral Methods (*work in progress*)
This repo contains a bunch of small scripts to play with the creation of hierarchical quasi-random low-discrepancy sequences and to compute various discrepancy-related metrics to analyze the generated points.

Unfortunately this direction has been on hold for the past couple of years but I'm still quite interested in the topic, please let me know if you would like to discuss or collaborate!
